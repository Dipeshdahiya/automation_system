# Automation & Python – Practical Task

A small, reliable automation system built in Python to demonstrate **clear thinking, safe failure handling, and structured design** for real-world automation problems.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project reads a folder of input files, validates required inputs, and safely processes them to produce:
- A **summary report**
- A **log file**

The focus is on **clarity, reliability, and predictable behavior**, not fancy features.
